# spyndee

A Python implementation of the board game 'Splendor' created by Marc Andre.

The dat.py file contains hard-coded game card data and I'll start to build around this. 

spyndee.py will render a basic board and instantiate some of the base components. For now it's simply rendering a text based board so I can quickly start building gameplay and AI. Later I can swap out the render methods to maybe do some GUI work.
